This class is a facade around SoundPool.

Essentially it adds functionality for ensuring 'sounds' are loaded before attempting to play them.   

This caused me a hugabyte of a headache. So hopefully I've solved this issue for others as well.

Should work on Android V2.3+


Example of usage:

``
test
``
